# Qualifiying assessment

This is a qualifying assessment meant to advance you automatically past the 001 learning progression. You have to make a submission of the following assignment in the [Lab Notebook](README.md). If you pass it, you will not have to go throught the [learning progression](learning-progression.md) and will get a number of points, equal to **half of the number of progression steps, rounded to an integer**, using the rule [round half up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Round_half_up): 5.49 rounds to 5, 5.50 rounds to 6.

## Assignment 

1. Write a micro:bit program such that: 
   1. It cycles through 3 different blinking icons, in the same order, upon pressing button A. 
   2. One of the icons should be of your own design. 
   3. Pressing button B should reverse the cycling order.
2. Save your program under [programs](programs) and link to it in the [Lab Notebook](README.md).
3. Write your program to your micro:bit and record a video in Yuja demonstrating its operation. Link to the video in the [Lab Notebook](README.md). _Note: Videos of the MakeCode simulator are not accepted. Your program should be running on your **device**._
